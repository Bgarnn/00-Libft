Libft - Your Custom C Library

Welcome to Libft, a comprehensive C library that serves as a foundational toolkit for your programming endeavors. This project focuses on implementing essential functions, providing a reusable set of tools to streamline your C programming tasks.

** Project Overview **

What does Libft do?
Libft is a collection of essential C functions covering various domains such as string manipulation, memory allocation, linked list operations, and more. It is designed to be a versatile toolbox, enabling you to write efficient and clean code without having to reinvent the wheel for common tasks.

The library includes functions like ft_strlen, ft_strcpy, ft_memset, ft_lstnew, and many others. Each function is implemented with careful consideration for performance, clarity, and adherence to standard C library conventions.

** How to Compile Libft **

To compile the Libft library, follow these simple steps:

Clone the Repository:
    git clone git@github.com:Bgarnn/libft.git
    cd libft
Compile the Library:
    make:  This will generate the libft.a static library.
Clean the Build:
    make clean: This removes the object files, keeping only the compiled library.
    
** Now you're ready to integrate Libft into your projects! Simply link your programs with libft.a during compilation.
